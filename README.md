# My RSS Subscriptions

[XML export](subscriptions.xml) of my RSS subscriptions from [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com).
Mostly centered around:
- Frontend Development
- Fullstack Development
- HTML
- CSS
- Accessibility
- Web Performance
- Browsers
- Eleventy

You can find a [full list of blogs I subscribe to](https://alistairshepherd.uk/writing/frontend-feeds-newsletters/) plus newsletters on my blog, with short annotations and summaries.
There are slight differences from the export to that list as some I check outwith FeedBin or are not super relevant to the list but it saves maintaining 2!
